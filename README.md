**FIT2102 A1**

Overview: Students will work independently to create a classic arcade game using
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) techniques. Programs will be implemented in
TypeScript and use RxJS Observable streams to handle animation, user interaction, and
other similar stream behaviours. The goal is to demonstrate a good understanding
of functional programming techniques as explored in the first five weeks of the
unit, including written documentation of the design decisions and features.
